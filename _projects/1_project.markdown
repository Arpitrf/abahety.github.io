title: COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Degradation Prediction
duration: (August - October 2020)
description: RNA molecules have the tendency to spontaneously degrademodel which can render the mRNA vaccine useles. In this Kaggle challenge, I have developed models that will predict likely degradation rates at each base of an RNA molecule.

Implemented an attention, Graph Neural Network based model with autoencoder pretraining in keras. Additional 
features were extracted from arnie package. Train and test-time augmentations used. Achieved a rank in top 6% and 
a bronze medal.
