A Web-application developed in Node.js and React to provide a summary of a user's github profile. It provides a rating for a user and each of their repositories evaluating on various metrics like "Stars", "Number of Commits" etc. It is a powerful tool which can be used by organisations and hackathons alike to shortlist and analyse candidates with the feature to select language preference.
