Assessing the number of street trees is important for assessing the greenery in cities and can help municipalities to employ solutions to identify areas with less urban trees. It can also help to identify which areas have had more urban trees cut and grown over time. Yet, there has been little work in this area of quantification of urban trees. In this work, we develop a street tree detection and counting mechanism. We further showcase the results using two separate methods and their corresponding visualizations. The first is a Category Map which is based on a novel Tree Index that is proposed by us. The second is a  Density map which is obtained using the technique of Kernel Density Ranking. We also release a public dataset of annotated street trees in Indian road scenes.
