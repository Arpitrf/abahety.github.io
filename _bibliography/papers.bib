abstract = {Assessing the number of street trees is essential for evaluating urban greenery and can help municipalities employ solutions to identify tree-starved streets. It can also help identify roads with different levels of deforestation and afforestation over time. Yet, there has been little work in the area of street trees quantification. This work first explains a data collection setup carefully designed for counting roadside trees. We then describe a unique annotation procedure aimed at robustly detecting and quantifying trees. We work on a dataset of around 1300 Indian road scenes annotated with over 2500 street trees. We additionally use the five held-out videos covering 25 km of roads for counting trees. We finally propose a street tree detection, counting, and visualization framework using current object detectors and a novel yet simple counting algorithm owing to the thoughtful collection setup. We find that the high-level visualizations based on the density of trees on the routes and Kernel Density Ranking (KDR) provide a quick, accurate, and inexpensive way to recognize tree-starved streets. We obtain a tree detection mAP of 83.74% on the test images, which is a 2.73% improvement over our baseline. We propose Tree Count Density Classification Accuracy (TCDCA) as an evaluation metric to measure tree density. We obtain TCDCA of 96.77% on the test videos, with a remarkable improvement of 22.58% over baseline, and demonstrate that our counting module's performance is close to human level.

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
