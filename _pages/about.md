Hello! I will be pursuing MS in Computer Science at the Columbia university starting Fall 2021. I am currently working as a Research Fellow at the [Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT)](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) at IIIT Hyderabad in the domain of Computer Vision (Please take a look at the projects page for more information). Here, I have been fortunate to receive mentorship from [Prof. Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla](https://ravika.github.io/), [Dr. Anbumani Subramanian](https://sites.google.com/view/anbumani/home?authuser=0), [Dr. Rohit Saluja](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~rohitsaluja/) and [Prof. C. V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/).

My research interests boradly lies in the domain of Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision and Robotics. I am particularly interested in the field of Meta learning, Incremental Learning and Few-shot Learning. I am also eager to explore AI with applications to perception and planning for robots, healthcare and road safety.

Prior to CVIT, I had pursued a research internship at the Creative Cognition Group at the Frieie Universit√§t Berlin where I worked at the intersection of AI and Congtion. I finished my undergraduate from Indian Institute of Information Technology - Allahabad (IIIT-A) in 2019, with a degree in Information Technology. There, I have been lucky to be advised by some amazing people including [Prof. G. C. Nandi](https://sites.google.com/site/gcnandi/Home) and [Dr. Bibhas Ghoshal](https://profile.iiita.ac.in/bibhas.ghoshal/).
