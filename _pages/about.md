I am an MS in Computer Science student at Columbia university. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Shuran Song](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~shurans/) and to be a member of the [Columbia Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR) lab](https://cair.cs.columbia.edu/).

I am broadly interested in perception and manipulation for robotics, and developing intelligent behaviour through interaction.

I previously worked as a Research Fellow at the [Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT)](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) at IIIT Hyderabad in the domain of Computer Vision where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla](https://ravika.github.io/) and [Prof. C. V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/). I had pursued a research internship at the Creative Cognition Group at the Frieie Universit√§t Berlin where I worked at the intersection of AI and Cognition. I finished my undergraduate from Indian Institute of Information Technology - Allahabad (IIIT-A) in 2019, with a degree in Information Technology where I was lucky to be advised by [Prof. G. C. Nandi](https://sites.google.com/site/gcnandi/Home).
