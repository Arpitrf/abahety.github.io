Hello! I am currently working as a Research Fellow at the [Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT)](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) where I have been fortunate to receive mentorship from [Prof. C V Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/), [Dr. Anbumani Subramanian](https://sites.google.com/view/anbumani/home?authuser=0) and [Dr. Rohit Saluja](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~rohitsaluja/)

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
